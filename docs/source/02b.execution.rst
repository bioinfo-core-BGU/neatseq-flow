Step 1: Workflow script generation
====================================

Using the GUI
---------------

To execute the script generator, go to the ``Run`` tab and click on ``Generate scripts``.

If you see the following lines in the ``Terminal`` box, then the scripts were generated successfully::

      Reading files...
      Preparing objects...
      Creating directory structure...
      Making step instances...
      Building scripts...
      Making workflow plots...
      Writing JSON files...
      Finished successfully....



Using the command line
--------------------------

Executing **NeatSeq-Flow**'s script generator is done as follows (make sure ``python`` and ``neatseq_flow.py`` are in your search path)::

    python neatseq_flow.py                      \
        -s sample_file.nsfs                     \
        -p param_file1.nsfp,param_file2.nsfp    \
        -m "message"                            \
        -d /path/to/workflow/directory

If you get ``Finihed successfully...`` then the scripts were generated successfully.

**Comments**:

- **NeatSeq-Flow** does not require installation. If you have a local copy, append the full path to ``neatseq_flow.py``.
- It is not compulsory to pass a message via ``-m`` but it is highly recommended for documentation and reproducibility.
- if ``-d`` is omitted, the current directory will be used as the workflow location.


Step 2: Executing the workflow
====================================

Using the GUI
---------------

To run the full workflow, click on ``Run scripts`` in the ``Run`` tab.

.. Note:: It is not possible to execute individual steps or samples with the GUI.

Using the command line
--------------------------

The workflow can be executed fully automatically; on a step-by-step basis or for individual samples separately.

1. **Automatic execution**

   Execute the following command within the workflow directory::

      bash scripts/00.workflow.commands.sh

   The ``scripts/00.workflow.commands.sh`` script runs all the steps at once, leaving flow control entirely to the cluster job manager.

2. **Step-wise execution**

   Each line in ``scripts/00.workflow.commands.sh`` calls a step-wise script in ``scripts/``, *e.g.* ``scripts/01.merge_merge1.sh``, which contains a list of ``qsub`` commands executing the individual scripts on each sample.

   The following command will execute only the ``merge1`` step::

      qsub scripts/01.merge_merge1.sh

3. **Sample-wise execution**

   The individual sample-level scripts are stored in folders within ``scripts/``. *e.g* all ``merge1`` scripts are stored in ``scripts/01.merge_merge1/``. To execute the step only for a specific sample, execute the relevant script from within the individual script folder.
