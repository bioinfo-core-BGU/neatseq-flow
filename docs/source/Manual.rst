Introduction
==============

The following sections provide a detailed description of **NeatSeq-Flow** usage.

**NeatSeq-Flow** is executed in 3 steps:

1. Preparing the sample and parameter files.
2. Shell script generation
3. Shell script execution.

In the script generation step, **NeatSeq-Flow** creates a set of directories in the workflow main directory, also described in the following sections.

The NeatSeq-Flow monitor enables tracking the execution process in the 3rs step above. The monitor, too, is descibed in the sections below.

**NeatSeq-Flow** can be used in two ways: with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or from the command line. The pages in this section describe usage of both methods.
