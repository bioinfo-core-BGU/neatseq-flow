Download and Install
===============================


1. Clone the package from github:

``git clone https://github.com/bioinfo-core-BGU/neatseq-flow.git``

2. You may have to install two `python` dependencies: `yaml` and `bunch`. This can be done with:

``pip install yaml bunch``

3. Clone the package of modules from github:

``git clone https://github.com/bioinfo-core-BGU/neatseq-flow-modules.git``

.. Note:: You can also download the repository code from the following links:

   * Main **NeatSeq-Flow** source code: https://github.com/bioinfo-core-BGU/neatseq-flow/archive/master.zip
   * Module and workflow repository: https://github.com/bioinfo-core-BGU/neatseq-flow-modules/archive/master.zip

Executing **NeatSeq-Flow**
-----------------------------

Create a new directory anywhere, `cd` into it and execute the following commands (``$NSF_main`` is the directory where **NeatSeq-Flow** is installed)::

    python $NSF_main/neatseq_flow.py                         \
        --sample_file $NSF_main/Workflows/PE_tabular.nsfs    \
        --param_file  $NSF_main/Workflows/mapping.yaml       \
        --message     "an informative message"

.. _install_with_conda:

Install and execute with **Conda**
====================================

1. Install `Miniconda`_.
2. Download the **NeatSeq-Flow** |conda_env|. 
3. Create an environment::

    conda-env create -f NeatSeq_Flow_conda_env.yaml

4. Activate the environment::

    source activate NeatSeq_Flow

5. Make a dir for your project and change into it::

    mkdir first_neatseq_flow_proj; cd first_neatseq_flow_proj

.. _Execution_section:
    
6. Execute **NeatSeq-Flow**::

    neatseq_flow.py                                                          \
        --sample_file $CONDA_PREFIX/NeatSeq-Flow-Workflows/PE_tabular.nsfs    \
        --param_file  $CONDA_PREFIX/NeatSeq-Flow-Workflows/mapping.yaml                   \
        --message     "an informative message"

    
7. When done, deactivate the environment::

    source deactivate

.. Note:: You don't need to have the environment activated in order to execute the scripts!
